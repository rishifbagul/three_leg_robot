# three_leg_robot
This project had an aim to find out the gait pattern for the three-legged robot using the deep deterministic policy gradient.

This project uses a Robot Operating System (ROS) for the implementation. Rviz and Gazebo for the physics engine environment. 
The DDPG Algorithm used is implemented in Python3 using  Keras.
